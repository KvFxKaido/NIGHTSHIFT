# CLAUDE.md

Context for AI assistants working on NIGHTSHIFT.

## What this is

A compact arcade street racer — night, one district, one car the player
grows attached to, rivals as driving personalities. The design document
at `design/GDD.md` is the source of truth; when this file and the GDD
disagree, the GDD wins, and when code and the GDD disagree, say so out
loud instead of quietly picking one.

Working title: Project Nightshift. Status: Early Concept — Phase 0.

## The two laws (non-negotiable)

1. **The renderer draws; the sim decides** (GDD §17.2). `src/sim/`
   imports nothing from three.js — no exceptions, no "just this once."
   Vehicle state, race rules, rival behavior, progression, traffic,
   input mapping: all sim. The render layer translates state into
   meshes, lights, particles, and camera; it never decides anything.
2. **The sim is deterministic.** Fixed tick (`TICK_HZ` in
   `src/sim/sim.ts`), no clock, no `Math.random`, no platform queries
   inside the sim. Every tick's input is logged; (start state + input
   log) must always reproduce the run. This is the ghost/replay
   foundation and it cannot be retrofitted, so any change that would
   break it is a design discussion, not a refactor. When Rapier carries
   physics, it steps inside the sim tick at fixed DT — never in the
   render loop — and its determinism constraints (same build, fixed
   timestep) are part of law 2.

## House rules (inherited from the SENTINEL workshop)

- **Execute the claim.** Before asserting something is verified, run the
  exact thing that would fail if the assertion were false. Inspecting
  code, narrating arithmetic, or grepping for the convenient form of a
  pattern is a claim wearing verification's clothes.
- **The out-of-scope list is binding** (GDD §21). Police, pedestrians,
  multiplayer, weather, more cities, big car rosters — reconsidered only
  after the core loop has proven itself. Scope expansion is the named
  risk; do not be the vector.
- **Handling is the first quality gate** (GDD §22). Poor handling cannot
  be rescued by more content. Phase 1 work outranks everything until the
  car feels good.
- Phase 0's placeholder kinematics in `src/sim/sim.ts` are NOT the
  handling model and set no precedent. Replace, don't extend.

## Current state

Phase 0 wiring: input → fixed-tick sim → chase camera, input log
recording, Rapier wasm pipeline initialized (physics unused until
Phase 1). `pnpm dev` to run, `pnpm build` to typecheck + build. CI runs
the build on every push.

## Relationship to SENTINEL

Same engineering doctrine, different universe — deliberately. Do not
import SENTINEL lore, factions, or aesthetics here; the decision and its
reasoning live in the SENTINEL session history (2026-07-30). If a
crossover ever happens, it is Shawn's call at naming time, not an
assistant's flourish.
